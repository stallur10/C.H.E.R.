# FremdHacks Hackathon 2024 - Shreyas Talluri, Sahil Khunt (**FIRST PLACE**)
**C.H.E.R. - Comprehensive Human Emotion Recognition**\
C.H.E.R. uses AI and computer vision to help parents and schools detect early signs of depression in teens, aiming to prevent suicide by notifying trusted adults so teens can get the help they need.


**WHAT IT DOES**\
C.H.E.R. is a cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence Model that has been trained using over 35,000 images of human emotion. Integrating C.H.E.R. with Computer Vision, we equipped her with the ability to detect the real-time emotions of her subject. This alone, is just the tip of the iceberg. Utilizing data storage techniques and our knowledge of front-end development, we created the ability for the guardians of C.H.E.R.’s subjects to receive updates on their child’s mental health in real time. By acting as an intelligent intermediary, C.H.E.R. eliminates parental stress by minimizing consequences caused by a lack of communication between the parents and the child, bolstering the relationships children have with their parents.


**BUILT WITH**\
Python, React, Tensorflow, Firebase, openCV, Twilio, Kaggle
